# Data Centric Development Project

The purpose of this project is to create a web application that enables the users of this web site to view recipes and store their favorite recipes to the site. This web application serves as a central repository for users to store their favorite recipes.

## UX
 
This webpage was created for anyone who has an interest in cooking to allow users to search for recipes based on different search criterias. Users are able to search by criterias such as cuisine type, difficulty level of the recipe and course type. As a user, I want to be able to search recipes based on difficulty level so that I can cook the recipes according to my cooking skills. As a user, I want to be able to view the recipes details so that I can cook the recipes. As a user, I want to be able to edit the recipes so that I can improve on the recipes. As a user, I want to be able to add recipes so that I can store more recipes to the web site.

I have also included the wireframes for this project in the static folder, both the website view and mobile view of how the website appears.

## Features

In the home page, the web site displays all the recipes available without any filters. The user can edit and delete the recipe from the home page itself. The website has a navigation bar on top of the web page. The navigation bar shows the filters of the website. The user can filter the recipes by cuisine type, difficulty level of the recipe and course type.
 
### Features Left to Implement

Other future features such as adding upvotes, the user is able to like the recipe. The recipes can be sorted according to number of upvotes. Other optional features such as basic registration and logging in to the webpage as a registered user.
